# AutoML-ICML2021

This corresponds to all the code associated to our sequential AutoML project submitted to Automl@ICML2021 workshop.

The files to reproduce the figures are:
- DESCRIPTIVE_STATISTICS
- EXPERIMENT_RESULTS

The other files are to reproduce the Experiment.

The results file used in the paper is too heavy for Git upload but is available upon request: maxime[[dot]]heuillet[[dot]]france[[at]]gmail[[dot]]com
